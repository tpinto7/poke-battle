# poke-battle
A battle simulator based off the popular series Pokemon!
This program was a console, text-based simulator of Pokemon game mechanics. It is written in C# and contains the original starter Pokemon:
Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur, and Pikachu. 
The game was largely overhauled in the repository titled Gen 1 Pokemon Battle Simulator, which utilizes abstract classes and inheritance
to create a more intricate and replicative game.
